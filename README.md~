EMEWS project template
-----------------------

You have just created an EMEWS project.

This project is compatible with swift-t v. 1.3+. Earlier
versions will NOT work.

The project consists of the following directories:

```
  data/
  ext/
  etc/
  scripts/
  swift/
  model/
  README.md
```
The directories are intended to contain the following:

 * `data` - model input etc. data
 * `etc` - additional code used by EMEWS
 * `scripts` - any necessary scripts (e.g. scripts to launch a model), excluding
    scripts used to run the workflow.
 * `swift` - swift code
 * `model` - should contain the model itself

The compiled PhysiCell model should be copied into the model directory and be named
cancer-immune-EMEWS.

Before running the algorithms make sure EMEWS is installed:
	https://emews.github.io/
	
It is recommended to use the Spack package manager
	https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	
To set up PhysiCell:
	~/cancer-immune/PhysiCell-src$ make -f Makefile-immune 
	~/cancer-immune/PhysiCell-src$ cancer-immune-EMEWS2 config/PhysiCell_settings_immune.xml 

If you have troubles running the project, check that the project is set up correctly. Here is a summary of commands to do so (see https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell-EMEWS-2/tree/master/cancer-immune/PhysiCell-src):

	make : compiles the current project. If no project has been defined, it first populates the cancer heterogeneity 2D sample project and compiles it

	make : populates the indicated sample project. Use "make" to compile it.

	<project_name> choices: template2D template3D biorobots-sample cancer-biorobots-sample heterogeneity-sample cancer-immune-sample

	make clean : removes all .o files and the executable, so that the next "make" recompiles the entire project

	make data-cleanup : clears out all simulation data

	make reset : de-populates the sample project and returns to the original PhysiCell state. Use this when switching to a new PhysiCell sample project.
 
To run the model exploration methods go to:

	cd cancer-immune/EMEWS-scripts/swift/

Open the file
	
	run_bas.sh  # for HNS and IHR
	run_rs.sh   # for PRS
	
and change it according to your needs. You can set up the optimization strategy, cooling schedule, number of iterations. Moreover, the maximum Walltime, nodes, etc can be chosen. The script is commented and thus self explaining.

Finally, run

	./bas_workflow.sh <experimentname> ~/EMEWS-scripts/data/ga_params.json

or 

	./rs_workflow.sh <experimentname> ~/EMEWS-scripts/data/ga_params.json
